# hello-world

What can i say.
Im just a lowly peasant
learning this great structure
created by networks unknown
to my perception.

I took my first step into
this binary world not long ago.
Learned the difference between
Ones and zeroes
The truth and false.

The struggle to move
my ever learning feet
to take another step
against the unknown stream
of bits, just to gain
a byte of knowledge.

Now, I've come upon an even
Greater project to conquer.
Here I take my first, 
out of the million commits.
Though I might fall, 
im sure Google will be there.
